      <p class="text-2xl text-gray-600 mb-4">Kindergarten Principal,</p>
      <div class="space-y-4 text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        <p>
          Maydy Farag is the Kindergarten Principal at Al Maaref American School, bringing with her over 25 years of experience in early childhood education, including more than 3 years in her current leadership role. Throughout her career, she has remained passionate about building strong foundations for young learners through a nurturing, inclusive, and academically enriching environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maydy is a firm believer in the power of purposeful play, inquiry-based learning, and hands-on experiences to develop the whole childâ€”cognitively, socially, emotionally, and physically. Under her leadership, the KG department has grown into a dynamic space where children are encouraged to explore, question, and create, while building essential early literacy, numeracy, and communication skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her approach to leadership is collaborative and child-centered. She works closely with her team to align teaching practices with international standards, ensure readiness for inspection frameworks such as KHDA and NEASC, and continuously innovate through professional development and curriculum review.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maydy also values strong partnerships with families and believes that early education is most successful when parents and educators work together. She is often seen greeting students and parents each morning, fostering a warm and welcoming school culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of school, Maydy has a passion for travel and has visited more than 25 countries, gaining global insights that inform her educational vision and leadership. She also enjoys spending quality time with her family and exploring new ideas in early years education.
