            A Warm Welcome from Our Principal, D. Pinkerton
            </h2>
          <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            As-salamu alaikum. It is with great pleasure and enthusiasm that I join Al Maareef Private School community 
            which is so rich in tradition, Islamic values, and desire bring out the best of its students. 
            As your dedicated principal, I bring a wealth of experience from my many years of leadership in the USA, Italy, Bahrain, and the UAE. 
            Having worked in both the US and the GCC region for several years, I have a solid foundation
            in blending the American curriculum, teaching methods, and philosophies alongside the unique culture of the UAE.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            One of my core passions is promoting student agencyâ€”empowering our young learners to take ownership of their education
            and become active contributors to their community. I believe in cultivating not only academic excellence but also the 
            values of compassion, respect, and responsibility.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            I believe that education extends beyond the classroom walls so 
            I will work to ensure that students are provided with a range of activities to broaden their learning experiences. 
            I will continue to recognize the importance of a school community that values open communication, collaboration, and the well-being of every child.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            I am excited about the journey ahead and look forward to partnering with you to shape a 
            bright and promising future for our students. Together, let us create a nurturing space 
            where our children can flourish academically, spiritually, and socially.
